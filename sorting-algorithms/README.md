# Sorting Algorithms

This project seeks to implement the common sorting algorithms insertion sort,
mergesort, heapsort, and quicksort. Complexity and performance analysis is also
performed.

For the purpose of this project, "sorted" means ascending order.

# Building
`cmake` and `make` are required. Run the following commands in a terminal to
build this software:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will produce an executable titled `sorting-algorithms` in the directory 
`build`.

# TODO:
- [ ] function pointer does not work
- [ ] always runs only one iteration (bring back min/max/avg)
